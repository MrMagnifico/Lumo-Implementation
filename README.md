# Lumo Implementation
This repository contains a (partial) implementation of the techniques presented in [Lumo: Illumination for Cel Animation](http://ivizlab.sfu.ca/arya/Papers/ACM/NPAR-02/Illumination%20for%20Cel%20Animation.pdf) which are used to generate normals for 2D drawings to allow them to be rendered using typical computer graphics techniques. This implementation is part of the requirements for the paper presentation assignment for the course IN4152 3D Computer Graphics and Animation at TU Delft
